This project implements an autoencoder using a simple neural network (NN) class in Python, trained on the digit '2' from the MNIST dataset. It compresses input data to a lower-dimensional representation and reconstructs it. The network includes multiple hidden layers and uses backpropagation to minimize reconstruction error. Results are visualized by comparing original and reconstructed images.
